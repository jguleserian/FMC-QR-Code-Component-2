## Overview

Your challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Workflow:

1. Set up folders and file structure, set up README.md, create GitHub repo and link it to VS Code 
2. Determine strategy for structuring the page
3. HTML: set major structure with containers, placing the general content within them
4. HTML: starting from the top with each major container, assign content to individual elements and arrange them as necessary.
5. HTML: link and place <picture> and <img> / <source> files as necessary. Set media query sizes as necessary.
6. CSS: set up.
  - "Pencil in" the major structure using GPS: "reset & variables," "containers," "elements," "classes & ids," "media queries"
  - Write the CSS for the page reset in the ":root," <html>, <body>, and *. I generally put in the variable for colors, font, etc. at this time.
  - Set the media queries, adding in a change of background color so I can visually identify what query I am viewing and to have an element in the query as a placeholder
7. Starting from top to bottom in the HTML, set the CSS styles. 
8. Style/add hover states and animation as necessary
9. Clean up code
10. Test functionality, responsiveness, and similitud with original model in Figma/style guide
11. Upload and publish

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [GPS for CSS Organization](https://github.com/jescalan/gps) - This is the guide I have been using to organize my CSS. It is much more succinct than other methods, accommodates large projects and collaboration and is logically formed, and so logical to read.
