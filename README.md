## Overview

The challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I also added a couple of extras including:
- A drop-shadow hover effect for the QR code
- Turn the QR code into a live, clickable link

## My process

### Workflow:

1. Set up folders and file structure, set up README.md, create GitHub repo and link it to VS Code 
2. Determine strategy for structuring the page
3. HTML: set major structure with containers, placing the general content within them
4. HTML: starting from the top with each major container, assign content to individual elements and arrange them as necessary.
5. HTML: link and place <picture> and <img> / <source> files as necessary. Set media query sizes as necessary.
6. CSS: set up.
  - "Pencil in" the major structure using GPS: "reset & variables," "containers," "elements," "classes & ids," "media queries"
  - Write the CSS for the page reset in the ":root," <html>, <body>, and *. I generally put in the variable for colors, font, etc. at this time.
  - Set the media queries, adding in a change of background color so I can visually identify what query I am viewing and to have an element in the query as a placeholder
7. Starting from top to bottom in the HTML, set the CSS styles. 
8. Style/add hover states and animation as necessary
9. Clean up code
10. Test functionality, responsiveness, and similitud with original model in Figma/style guide
11. Upload and publish

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

The purpose of redoing this project was to follow the learning path suggestions. Just to make sure there are no gaps in my understanding, I have decided to walk throught the learning paths one at a time form the beginning.

### Continued development

Specifically, to walk through all the learning paths of Frontend Mentor.

### Useful resources

- [GPS for CSS Organization](https://github.com/jescalan/gps) - This is the guide I have been using to organize my CSS. It is much more succinct than other methods, accommodates large projects and collaboration and is logically formed, and so logical to read.
